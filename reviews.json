        "comment": "i passed for the first time today!\n\ni had been learning with abu ashraf for a total of 6 months and they were probably the best months ever! abu ensured that every single lesson we had together was full of laughter but also seriousness, a good balance of the two resulted with our lessons never being boring.\n\nabu always remained patient and made sure i always understood what he would teach me and if i didn’t understand something he would go over it again until i did. i also had a few gaps whilst i was learning how to drive as i went on holiday and i’m currently at university so i’ve moved away.\n\ni had a 3 week nearly 4 week gap but i did back to back lessons for 4 days straight with abu and it was more than enough for me to pass! abu ashraf is an amazing instructor who will definitely secure you a straight pass."
