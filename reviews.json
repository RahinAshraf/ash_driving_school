He‚Äôs so patient and teaches you like you are a five year old. He took me round all test routes and he was just the best. \n\nI passed my driving test at one go with just minor fault. My wife equally passed her test with him with one minor fault. If you are looking for an instructor who is well detailed and pays attention to details then Abu Ashraf is you go to person. 5 star rating for him."

I came to Ashraf about 5 months before my test. I tried a few instructors before, but they made me feel quite unsafe and I was not learning anything properly, so I stopped my lessons with them. On my first day with Ashraf, he immediately proved himself as a knowledgeable, pedagogical, and dedicated instructor. \n\nI was very impressed. Then for 5 months we took lessons, twice a week and more frequently in the leadup to my test. He walked me through everything, explaining everything carefully and offering a lot of encouragement along the way. I will miss Abu Ashraf a lot in the future when I will be driving my own car, without him sitting next to me. He has prepared me for a lifetime of safe driving, for which I cannot thank him enough!"

He encouraged me and motivated me. While being very serious , he would throw in some jokes so that you can feel at ease. \n\nMr Ash is very competent and patient, he would teach until you feel you are confident enough to drive. He saw I had some weaknesses and taught me over and over again until I understood it. Mr Ash was dedicated to seeing me pass, I saw this dedication with other students too. I have recommended to everyone and I will still do. I am glad I had an amazing instructor like Mr Abu Ashraf."
